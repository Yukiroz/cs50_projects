Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

I didn't realise that the first 10 simulation whould be slower than the next 100 ones.
It probably has to do with the program compiling for the first time in the first instance of the program running.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

After running multiple 100000 simulations I found that the results whould be in a range of 0.4 from one to the other.
It seems to be pretty accurate without taking even longer than a second.
I find that to be good enough.
